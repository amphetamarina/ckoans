=== Sections vs Segments ===

Sections (linker view):
  .text   - executable code
  .data   - initialized data
  .bss    - uninitialized data
  .rodata - read-only data

Segments (loader view):
  LOAD segment 1: R+E (.text + .rodata)
  LOAD segment 2: RW  (.data + .bss)

Example data:
  initialized: 42 (in .data)
  uninitialized: 0 (in .bss)
  read-only: 100 (in .rodata)

  readelf -S ./broken  # View sections
  readelf -l ./broken  # View segments

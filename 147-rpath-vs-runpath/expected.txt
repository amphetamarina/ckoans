RPATH vs RUNPATH
================

RPATH:
  - Embedded at link time
  - Searched BEFORE LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  - Cannot be overridden
  - Use: -Wl,-rpath,/path

RUNPATH:
  - Newer mechanism
  - Searched AFTER LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  - Can be overridden
  - Use: -Wl,--enable-new-dtags,-rpath,/path

Dynamic linker search order:
1. RPATH
2. LD_LIBRARY_PATH
3. RUNPATH
4. /etc/ld.so.cache
5. Default paths (/lib, /usr/lib)

Key difference: RPATH cannot be overridden by LD_LIBRARY_PATH

=== ASLR Impact ===

Run this program multiple times.
With ASLR enabled, addresses will change each time.

ASLR makes these addresses unpredictable.
This prevents attackers from hardcoding addresses.

Check ASLR status:
  cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
  (2 = full ASLR, 1 = partial, 0 = disabled)
